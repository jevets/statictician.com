This is the first post to my new blog, Statictician.

Statictician refers to my approach to building websites and web apps: no server side processing, statically-generated HTML files, heavy use of APIs instead... basically, the same principles as the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/).

### I'm Steve.

I've been working with the web since before CSS existed, back in the days of using HTML tables for layout, slicing up images to present "posters" that we called websites. For years, I've pushed, sold, and built static sites.

I've done plenty of dynamic site work, as well, including WordPress, Drupal, and similar CMS-based sites (damn monoliths), custom apps for all sorts of industries and clients, typically using frameworks like CodeIgniter, Laravel, CakePHP, Kohana, and even a bit of Zend.

But static sites were always my favorite, and they always performed far, far better. Plus, they saved my customers lots of money, especially those that only need a few changes a year.

[Statictician](https://www.statictician.com/) offers posts about my transition from PHP-based, server-side reliant thinking and coding to static for all the things, including static site generators, netlify, cloud / serverless functions, API consumption, single page apps, JavaScript based UI rendering, and so on.

### Current stack

At the time of writing, this site is currently built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and some quick nasty CSS. The writing is more important at this point, but I certainly plan to enhance the site as I go. So please, pardon the dust and other nast. Feel free to check out the [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jevets/statictician.com/).

*Rough Road Map*

- RSS feed
- May switch to a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme. I do love Eleventy, but Hugo's quite nice and has some really good themes available
- New Design, probably with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Comments? Not sure I want to bother... but if I do, I'll probably just drop a Disqus widget in here
