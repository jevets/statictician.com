This is the first post to my new blog, Statictician.

Statictician refers to my approach to building websites and web apps: no server side processing, statically-generated HTML files, heavy use of APIs instead... basically, the same principles as the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/).

### I'm Steve.

I've been working with the web since before CSS existed, back in the days of using HTML tables for layout, slicing up images to present "posters" that we called websites. For years, I've pushed, sold, and build static sites. I've done plenty of dynamic site work, including WordPress & Drupal sites, custom apps for all sorts of industries, typically using frameworks like CodeIgniter, Laravel, CakePHP, Kohana, and even a bit of Zend.

But static sites were always my favorite, and they always performed far better. Plus, they saved my customers tons of money, especially those that only need a few changes a year.

[Statictician](https://www.statictician.com/) offers posts about my transition from PHP-based, server-side reliant thinking and coding to static for all the things, including static site generators, netlify, cloud / serverless functions, API consumption, single page apps, JavaScript based UI rendering, and so on.
